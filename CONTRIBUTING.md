Welcome to Learn-C contributing guidelines. We greatly appreciate your interest in helping others learn and enhance their C programming skills. To ensure a smooth contribution process, kindly follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the repository that you can work on.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.
3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making any changes, create a new branch with a descriptive name for your feature or fix using
   ```bash
   git checkout -b branch-name.
   ```
4. **Make Changes**: Make your desired changes to the `LearnC` content. Ensure that you changes align with the style and structure of the existing content.
5. **Testing**: If you contribution involves new code examples or exercises, test them thoroughly to ensure they work as intended
6. **Commit Changes**: Commit your changes with clear and concise commit messages. Use the present tense and provide a brief description of the changes you made.
7. **Open an Issue**: For each pull request (PR) you plan to submit, first create a corresponding issue in the repository. This issue should briefly outline the purpose of your PR and the changes you're proposing. This step aids in initiating discussions and gaining initial feedback.
   > **Important**
   Pull Requests having no issue associated with them will not be accepted. Firstly get an issue assigned, whether it's already opened or raised by you, and then create a Pull Request.
9. **Pull Request**: Push your changes to your forked repository and create a pull request (PR) to the original repository's `main` branch. Descripe the purpose and details of you contribution in the PR description. Refer to the associated Issue in the Description too.
    - If your Pull Request fixes issue #25, add `Fixes #25` or `Closes #25` to the description.
    - If your Pull Request addresses multiple issues, list them using the same syntax (`Fixes #23, Fixes #15`).
11. **Engage in the Review Process**: The repository's maintainers will review your PR, providing insights and suggestions as neccessary. Feel free to participate in discussions if further clarification is needed
12. **Merge and Close**: Once your PR has been approved and successfully passes all relevant tests, it will be merged into the main repository. Your valuable contribution will then be integrated into the tutorial! YAY!!

Additional Guidelines:
- Please make sure there isn't already an existing issue related to your proposed changes. This step helps streamline the contribution process and prevents duplication of efforts.
- If introducing new code examples or exercises, make certain they are easily comprehensible, concise, and pertinent to the tutorial's topic.
- Respect and adhere to the repository's code of conduct, ensuring courteous and professional interactions.
- If any uncertainties arise during the process, don't hesitate to ask for guidance by creating an issue or adding comments to the relevant PR.

We're delighted to have you as part of our LearnC's contributors. Thank you for your dedication to making this resource even more valuable. Happy contributing and coding!
