# File I/O

In this article you will learn what are files in C, why they are needed, and how to handle standard I/O in C with the help of different C functions like fopen(), fclose(), fprintf(), fscanf(), getc(), putc(), getw(), fseek(), etc. A file represents a sequence of bytes regardless of being a text file or a binary file.

A file is used to store huge data. C provides multiple file management functions like file creation, opening and reading files, Writing to the file, and closing a file. The file is used to store relevant data and file handling in C is used to manipulate the data.
